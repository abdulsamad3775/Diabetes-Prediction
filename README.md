Certainly, here's a shorter version of the README file:

# Diabetes Prediction ML Classification Project

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on health data, including features like pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset (`diabetes_data.csv`) contains health data and a binary label (1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes).

## Requirements
Install necessary libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Project Structure
- Data in the `data` folder.
- Jupyter Notebook (`Logistic_Regression.ipynb`) for model development.

## Model Building
1. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis for insights.
3. Model selection and evaluation (Logistic Regression).
4. Model deployment for practical use.

## Running the Notebook
Use `jupyter notebook Logistic_Regression.ipynb` to open and run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Conclusion
This project shows how to predict diabetes using machine learning. The model can be enhanced with more data and fine-tuning.
